# Components

## Lifecycle

::: details Glossary

- **Pure**: The idea that a function should produce no side-effects.
- **Side-effect**: A permanent, externally observable state change. :::

Ripple's component lifecycle is akin to Vue/Svelte/Solid. The root scope of your
component only runs once, akin to the "setup" scope in Vue/Svelte/Solid. However,
all child scopes such as nested template scopes, and blocks like `if` and `for`,
may rerun if they contain reactive variables within them. Therefore, it is
advisable to only write pure code within your components, and place side-effects
within `effect()` to ensure they only run when intended.

## Children

To pass elements to be nested within a component, simply nest them as you would
write HTML. By default, Ripple will make the content available as the `children`
prop, which you can then render using `{props.children}` (or simply `{children}`
if you destructured your props).

```ripple
import type { Children } from 'ripple';

component Card(props: { children: Children }) {
  <div class="card">{props.children}</div>
}

export component App() {
  // Use implicitly...
  <Card>
    <p>{'Card content here'}</p>
  </Card>

  // or pass children explicitly as a prop.
  component children() {
    <p>{'Card content here'}</p>
  }

  <Card {children} />
}
```

## Reactive Props

See [Reactivity](/docs/guide/reactivity#Props-and-Attributes).

## Prop Shorthands

```ripple
// Object spread
<div {...properties}>{'Content'}</div>

// Shorthand props (when variable name matches prop name)
<div {onClick} {className}>{'Content'}</div>

// Equivalent to:
<div {onClick} {className}>{'Content'}</div>
```

## Portal Component

The `Portal` component allows you to render (teleport) content anywhere in the DOM
tree, breaking out of the normal component hierarchy. This is particularly useful
for modals, tooltips, and notifications.

```ripple
import { Portal } from 'ripple';

export component App() {
  <div class="app">
    <h1>{'My App'}</h1>

    {/* This will render inside document.body, not inside the .app div */}
    <Portal target={document.body}>
      <div class="modal">
        <h2>{'I am rendered in document.body!'}</h2>
        <p>{'This content escapes the normal component tree.'}</p>
      </div>
    </Portal>
  </div>
}
```
